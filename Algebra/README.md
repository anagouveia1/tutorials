# Starting with the Polynomial Algebra Material :thinking:

This is a space that I've created to add materials related to some of the tutoring I've done in Algebra. 
The current images in this folder relate to a Review Sheet my students had in late December. :dog:

## The content reviewed in that sheet are listed below:

- Graphing Calculators
- Finding Relative Max & Min of Polynomials
- Factorization
- Solving Binomials
- Long Division of Polynomials
- Synthetic Division of Polynomials
- Possible Roots of Polynomials based on the Rational Root Theorem
- Polynomial functions based on rational and complex roots
- Conjugate Roots
- Use of DesCartes' rule of signs to determine possible number of roots.
- Finding all roots on different degree polynomials
- Writing polynomials based on rational coefficients with known roots

### Additional material learned within the current period, we have the introduction of:

- Binomial Theorem :heart:
- Pascal's Triangle  :heart::heart:
- Real mathematical applications of polynomials: The Box Problem.

## Understanding the Pieces of The Puzzle:

Our reviews have been centered on understanding the basic mathematics problems.
- :page_facing_up: [And the attached Review Document](https://github.com/anagouveia1/tutorials/blob/master/Algebra/Review%201202018.pdf)
This material goes over the latest Quiz, while tieing back the idea of what these mathematics are trying to do:

## Assembling it:
- :white_check_mark: [Solving]

From Polynomials -> Equation with Roots Listed.
From Roots -> Polynomials.

[In between these two conversion the use of beautiful mathematics to accomplish our operations]

### Don't forget:

- :white_check_mark: Basic Rules: +,-,x,/,^,^(1/n)... ;)
- :scroll: Basic Operations: A.B = C = 1

So long as you are conscious of the different tiny details of good mathematics,
a complete solution will help you get the grade you know you deserve! :point_up:

## Up Next:

Once we are good with the understanding how the process allows us to solve polynomials, and equations,
We'll get to the world problem of the box, and see how our formulas will allow us to apply mathematics into our day to day to find,
what we call "Optimized Solutions."

### Last Remarks:

:point_up: *These are resources I can recommend to every student regardless of their skill level or tech stats*

Highly opinionated :bomb:. Mostly backed by science.  
Comes in no particular order :recycle:

U like it? :star: it and [share](https://github.com/anagouveia1?tab=repositories) with a friendly developer!

*P.S. You [don't need to know](https://xkcd.com/1050/) all of that by heart to be a programmer.  
But knowing the stuff will help you become better! :muscle:*
