# Art of Oil Painting :thinking:

This is a space that I've created to add materials related to some of the tutoring I've done in Oil Painting. 
The current images in this folder relate to a Review Sheet my students had in early January. :dog:

## The content reviewed in that sheet are listed below:

- Physics of The Universe
- Universe, Solar System & Light Travel
- Global Maps
- Light & Heat
- Light Through Different Mediums
- Refraction
- Light Through a Prism
- What is Light?
- Shadows
- Rainbows
- Energy Waves
- Electromagnetic Waves
- Light Waves
- Mathematics of Waves
- Einstein thoughts about Light
- What is Color?
- Musical Nautilus
- Beyond Colors

## Additional material learned within the current period, we have the introduction of:

- Art Concepts :heart:
  - Geometry, Materials, Structures, Dynamics & Movement.
- Painting Layers :cat:
  - Defining Boundaries
  - Ratios & Other Math Terms
  - Visualizing Between the Lines
- Painting
  - Ideal Material Organizing Setup
  - From lines to backgrounds
  - Mixing Colors & Keeping Good Balance
  - System of Colors
  - Transparency & Glows
  - Mists & Smokes
  - Fine Line Details
  - Textures & Tones
 - Up Keep & Materials Maintenace
    - Stage Ready
    - Materials List
    - About Materials
    - Chemistry of Oil Paint
    - Cleaning Up Oil Paint
 = Notes & Questions
 
## THIS SOUNDS LIKE PHYSICS :star:

- :scroll: [Universe Lines](IMG0001.jpg)

For many year man qestioned how does all around us exist?
They thought, first there must be a universe.
How does it look like, we don't really know.

## Understanding the Pieces of The Puzzle: {Art Concepts} 

Our reviews have been centered on understanding the basic mathematics problems, behind art.

Next material will go over the latest Quiz, while tieing back the idea of what these mathematics are trying to do:

### Reflexes & Mirroring:

- :white_check_mark: [Solving] Can you find what is wrong in this image?

From Polynomials -> Equation with Roots Listed.
From Roots -> Polynomials.

[In between these two conversion the use of beautiful mathematics to accomplish our operations]

### Don't forget:

- :white_check_mark: Basic Rules: +,-,x,/,^,^(1/n)... ;)
- :scroll: Basic Operations: A.B = C = 1

So long as you are conscious of the different tiny details of good mathematics,
a complete solution will help you get the grade you know you deserve! :point_up:

## Up Next:

Once we are good with the understanding how the process allows us to solve polynomials, and equations,
We'll get to the world problem of the box, and see how our formulas will allow us to apply mathematics into our day to day to find,
what we call "Optimized Solutions."

### Last Remarks:

:point_up: *These are resources I can recommend to every student regardless of their skill level or tech stats*

Highly opinionated :bomb:. Mostly backed by science.  
Comes in no particular order :recycle:

U like it? :star: it and [share](https://github.com/anagouveia1?tab=repositories) with a friendly developer! 
U don't like it? [Watch the doggo](https://twitter.com/RespectfulMemes/status/900147758845308930) :dog:

*P.S. You [don't need to know](https://xkcd.com/1050/) all of that by heart to be a programmer.  
But knowing the stuff will help you become better! :muscle:*
